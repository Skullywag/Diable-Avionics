It had to be something very special as they seldom use outsider help for their shenanigans. That is when they do not need someone to take the fall, something to keep in mind should you accept the offer.\n\nThe job description is pretty laconic: the ==Tri-tachyon Corporation== somehow got their hands on a lost odd-ball ship of theirs, and they want it gone. The trick being that the ship is part of a fleet located in the well defended ==$system system==.\n\nThe documentation about the target is thorough, as you can expect from the life-long professionals of DA's intelligence offices, and paints quite an impressive ship. One you probably would not mind keeping if the option presented itself. The information about rest of the fleet are hazier, the target escorts are regularly rotated to prevent exactly what this offer is asking of you.",

None of those precious beings should have ever been sacrificed on the altar of greed and lust for power.

The flagship of this fleet was developed at the cost of countless innocent lives, such abhorrent creation must be destroyed.\"\n\nThe whole thing goes on a few more paragraphs without adding much substance.

        "job_description": "A Hegemony procurement office has issued a bounty for the destruction of a Diable Avionics fleet responsible for a recent raid on a high-security installation in the ==Naraka star systen==. While the Hegemony response prevented critical assets from being taken, logs indicate that the raiders escaped with several copies of classified research data and advanced prototype components for a ==reactor protocol of some sort==. If left unchecked, The Diable Avionics Corp may use this stolen material to develop and deploy new technologies across their fleets, posing a significant threat to Hegemony interests and sector stability.Independent captains are authorized to intercept and eliminate the target fleet. All stolen materials must be destroyed. The Hegemony will not attempt recovery of the items, prioritizing containment over reclamation. Payment will be issued upon confirmation of the fleet's elimination. The Hegemony is unable to confirm whetever or not the raiding fleet was be able to procure the ability to apply the prototype to ships within the fleet so prepare accordingly",
